## Overview {#overview}

ReMemory protects files by:

1. Encrypting them with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
1. Splitting the key among people you trust
1. Giving each person a self-contained bundle for recovery

Recovery works entirely offline, in a browser.\* No servers, no need for this website to exist.

<p style="font-size: 0.8125rem; color: #8A8480;">* <a href="#timelock" style="color: #8A8480;">Time-locked</a> archives need a brief internet connection at recovery time.</p>

<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> No one person can access your data. They need to bring together enough pieces — say, 3 of 5.
</div>

## Why ReMemory {#why-rememory}

You probably have digital secrets that matter: password manager recovery codes, cryptocurrency seeds, important documents, instructions for loved ones. What happens to these if you're suddenly unavailable?

Think of it like a safe deposit box that needs two keys to open — no single person holds enough to get in alone.

Traditional approaches have weaknesses:

- **Give one person everything** — a single point of failure and trust
- **Split files manually** — confusing, error-prone, no encryption
- **Use a password manager's emergency access** — similar to "give one person everything", also relies on the company existing
- **Write it in a will** — becomes public record, slow legal process

ReMemory takes a different approach:

- **No single point of failure** — requires multiple people to cooperate
- **No trust in any one person** — even your most trusted friend can't access your secrets alone
- **Offline and self-contained** — recovery works without internet or servers\*
- **Designed for anyone** — clear instructions, not cryptographic puzzles

## Creating Bundles {#creating}

Three steps. Everything happens in your browser — your files never leave your device.

### Step 1: Add Friends {#step1}

Add the people who will hold pieces of your recovery key. For each, provide a name and optionally contact information.

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/friends.png" alt="Adding friends in Step 1" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: Adding friends form</div>'">
<figcaption>Each person here will hold one piece of the key</figcaption>
</figure>

Then choose your **threshold** — how many people must come together to recover your files.

<div class="tip">
<strong>Choosing a threshold:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 people, threshold 2:</strong> The simplest setup</li>
<li><strong>5 people, threshold 3:</strong> A good balance</li>
<li><strong>7 people, threshold 4–5:</strong> More secure, more coordination</li>
</ul>
High enough that collusion is unlikely. Low enough that recovery works if one or two people are unavailable.
</div>

### Step 2: Add Files {#step2}

Drag and drop the files or folder you want to protect.

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/files.png" alt="Adding files in Step 2" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: File upload area</div>'">
<figcaption>Add the files you want to protect</figcaption>
</figure>

**Good candidates:**

- Password manager recovery codes
- Cryptocurrency seeds/keys
- Important account credentials
- Instructions for loved ones
- Legal document locations
- Safe combinations

<div class="warning">
<strong>Note:</strong> Avoid files that change often. This is designed for secrets you set once and leave.
</div>

### Step 3: Generate Bundles {#step3}

Click "Generate Bundles" to encrypt your files and create a bundle for each person.

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/bundles.png" alt="Generating bundles in Step 3" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: Bundle generation</div>'">
<figcaption>Download each bundle, or all at once</figcaption>
</figure>

Each bundle includes the full recovery tool. It works even if this website is gone.

### Distributing to Friends {#distributing}

Send each person their bundle however you prefer:

- **Email:** Attach the ZIP file
- **Cloud storage:** Share via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
- **USB drive:** Physical handoff
- **Encrypted messaging:** Signal, WhatsApp, etc.

### After Creating Bundles {#after-creating}

Once your bundles are ready, there are a few things worth doing before you put this out of your mind:

- Verify each person received their bundle and can open `recover.html`
- Tell each person what this is, why they have it, and that they should keep it safe. They cannot use it alone — they will need to coordinate with others.
- Keep a copy of `MANIFEST.age` somewhere safe — it's just encrypted data, useless without enough pieces
- Save your `project.yml` so you can regenerate bundles later
- Print `README.pdf` as a paper backup before sending the digital bundle. Paper doesn't need adapters or power.
- Set a yearly reminder to check in — see [Keeping Bundles Current](#keeping-current)

## Recovering Files {#recovering}

If you're here because someone you care about is no longer available — take a breath. There's no rush. The bundles don't expire, and the process is designed to be done at your own pace.

If you don't have a bundle yet, you can open the [recovery tool](recover.html) directly — you'll add pieces manually as you collect them from other holders.

### What Friends Receive {#bundle-contents}

Each bundle contains:

<div class="bundle-contents">
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">README.txt</span>
<span class="file-desc">Instructions, your unique piece, contact list</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">README.pdf</span>
<span class="file-desc">Same content, formatted for printing. Includes a <strong>QR code</strong> for importing the piece.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">MANIFEST.age</span>
<span class="file-desc">Your encrypted files. Included as a separate file for larger archives.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">recover.html</span>
<span class="file-desc">Recovery tool (~300 KB), runs in any browser</span>
</div>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
Each bundle is personalized — the friend's share is pre-loaded, and a contact list shows who else holds pieces. When the encrypted data is small enough, it's embedded too.
</p>

### Path A: I Have the Bundle ZIP {#recovery-bundle}

The simplest path. If you have the bundle ZIP (or the files from it):

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">1</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Extract the ZIP and open recover.html</h4>
<p>Open it in any modern browser. Your share is already loaded.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">2</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Load the encrypted manifest</h4>
<p>For small archives (≤ 10 MB), this is automatic — the data is already embedded. Otherwise, drag <code>MANIFEST.age</code> from the bundle onto the page.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">3</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Coordinate with other friends</h4>
<p>The tool shows a contact list with other friends' names and how to reach them. Ask them to send their <code>README.txt</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">4</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Add shares from other friends</h4>
<p>For each friend's piece: drag their <code>README.txt</code> onto the page, paste the text, or scan a QR code from their PDF. A checkmark appears as each piece is added.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">5</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Recovery happens automatically</h4>
<p>Once enough pieces are gathered (e.g., 3 of 5), recovery starts on its own.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If a friend sends their entire <code>.zip</code> bundle, drag it onto the page — both the piece and the archive are imported at once.
</div>

<figure class="screenshot">

<figcaption>Once threshold is met, files are decrypted and ready to download</figcaption>
</figure>

### Path B: I Have a Printed PDF with Words {#recovery-words}

Each printed PDF includes your share as a list of numbered words. Type them into the recovery tool — no camera or scanner needed.

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">1</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Open the recovery tool</h4>
<p>Visit the URL printed on the PDF, or open <code>recover.html</code> from any friend's bundle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">2</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Type in your recovery words</h4>
<p>Find the word list on your PDF and type the words into the text area. You don't need the numbers — just the words, separated by spaces.</p>
</div>
</div>

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/recovery-words-typing.png" alt="Typing recovery words from a printed PDF into the recovery tool" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: Typing recovery words from a printed PDF into the recovery tool</div>'">
<figcaption>Type the numbered words from your printed PDF into the text area</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/recovery-words-recognized.png" alt="Recovery tool after words have been entered, showing the share was recognized" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: Recovery tool after words have been entered, showing the share was recognized</div>'">
<figcaption>The recovery tool recognizes the words and loads your share</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">3</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Load the encrypted manifest</h4>
<p>You may need the <code>MANIFEST.age</code> file — drag it onto the page or click to browse. If you don't have it, any friend can send theirs. Every bundle has the same copy.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">4</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Collect shares from other friends</h4>
<p>Contact other friends and ask for their pieces. They can send their <code>README.txt</code>, read their words over the phone, or you can scan their QR code.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">5</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Recovery happens automatically</h4>
<p>Once the threshold is met, decryption starts immediately.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Words are the easiest to share over the phone. If a friend can't send their share digitally, they can read the words aloud and you type them in.
</div>

### Path C: I Have a Printed PDF with QR Code {#recovery-pdf}

If your device has a camera, scan the QR code on the PDF to import your share directly.

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">1</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Open the recovery tool</h4>
<p>Scan the QR code with your phone camera — it opens the recovery tool with your share pre-filled. Or visit the URL on the PDF and type the short code shown below the QR code.</p>
</div>
</div>

<figure class="screenshot">

<figcaption>Point your camera at the QR code on the printed PDF to import the share</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">2</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Load the encrypted manifest</h4>
<p>You may need the <code>MANIFEST.age</code> file — drag it onto the page or click to browse. If you don't have it, any friend can send theirs. Every bundle has the same copy.</p>

</figure>

<div class="step-guide">
<div class="step-number">3</div>
<div class="step-content">
<h4>Collect shares from other friends</h4>
<p>Contact other friends and ask for their pieces. They can send their <code>README.txt</code>, or you can scan their QR code.</p>

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

### Choosing Friends

- **Longevity:** People likely to be reachable in 5–10 years
- **Geographic spread:** Not all in the same place
- **Technical ability:** Any mix is fine — the tool is designed for everyone
- **Relationships:** Will they cooperate with each other?
- **Trust:** A single piece reveals nothing, but you're trusting them with responsibility

### Security Considerations

- Don't keep all bundles together — that defeats the point of splitting
- Consider printing `README.pdf` — paper survives digital disasters
- Save `project.yml` if you want to regenerate bundles later

### Storing Bundles Safely {#storing-bundles}

Bundles are small (under 10 MB) and designed to be stored in everyday places. Here's what works well:

- **Email** is a surprisingly good option. Most people keep the same email address for decades, and bundles are small enough to attach. Many email providers retain messages indefinitely.
- **Cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) works well as a secondary copy.
- **USB drives** can work, but keep in mind that connectors change over time (USB-A is already giving way to USB-C) and flash memory can degrade if left unpowered for years. Not ideal as the only copy.
- **Paper** is the most durable option. Printing `README.pdf` gives your friends a copy that doesn't need adapters, power, or any working device.

The best approach is redundancy — email plus paper, or cloud plus paper. More than one copy, in more than one form.

### Keeping Bundles Current {#keeping-current}

Set a yearly reminder to check in with your friends. Confirm they still have their bundles and update contact details if anything has changed.

When your files change, create new bundles and send them. The old bundles won't open the new archive, so there's no risk in leaving them around — but ask friends to replace theirs to keep things tidy.

When contacts change — someone moves, changes their phone number, or you want to add or remove someone — same thing: new bundles, ask people to delete the old ones.

Between updates, keep your source files in an encrypted vault — tools like [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) or [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr) work well. Don't leave plaintext copies sitting in a regular folder.

Think of it like updating your emergency contacts. Brief, periodic, worth doing.

### Revoking Access {#revoking-access}

Once a piece has been distributed, it cannot be revoked. This is by design — there is no server, no central authority.

If you need to change who holds pieces:

1. **Create new bundles** with a new set of friends and a fresh key
1. **Send new bundles** to the friends you still trust
1. **Ask every remaining friend to delete their old bundle** and replace it with the new one

<div class="warning">
<strong>Important:</strong> Old pieces still work with old archives. When you send a new bundle, be clear: <strong>delete the old one</strong>, keep only the new one. No version history, no "just in case."
</div>

The same applies when secrets change. New bundles mean a new key and new pieces. Old pieces won't open the new archive, but they still work with the old one. Make sure friends aren't holding on to old copies.

### About project.yml {#project-file}

When you create bundles, your project is saved in a `project.yml` file. This file stores:

- Friends' names and contact information
- Your chosen threshold (e.g., 3 of 5)
- A verification hash for checking if bundles match
- Share checksums for verifying bundle integrity

It does **not** store any secrets — no passphrase, no key material, no file contents. It's safe to keep alongside your other project files.

With `project.yml`, you can regenerate bundles, verify existing ones, and check the status of your setup.

## Understanding the Security {#security}

ReMemory composes well-established cryptographic tools rather than inventing its own. Here's what that means in practice.

### What Protects Your Data {#cryptography}

Your files are locked with a modern encryption tool ([age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)) — widely reviewed, no known weaknesses.

The key that locks them is 256 bits long, generated from your operating system's random number generator. For scale: guessing it would take longer than the universe has existed.

Even if someone tried every possible password, scrypt makes each guess deliberately slow — millions of times slower than a naive attempt.

The key is then split using Shamir's Secret Sharing. **Any fewer than *threshold* pieces contain zero information about the original.** Not "very little." Mathematically zero.

Each bundle includes checksums so the recovery tool can verify nothing was corrupted or tampered with.

### What Could Go Wrong {#what-could-go-wrong}

<div class="bundle-contents">
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">A friend loses their bundle</span>
<span class="file-desc">Fine, as long as enough other friends still have theirs. That's why you set the threshold below the total.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">A friend leaks their piece publicly</span>
<span class="file-desc">A single piece is useless without the others. Someone would still need threshold-1 more pieces to do anything.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">Some friends can't be reached</span>
<span class="file-desc">That's why you set the threshold below the total number of friends. If you chose 3-of-5, any three will do.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">ReMemory disappears in 10 years</span>
<span class="file-desc"><code>recover.html</code> still works — it's self-contained. No servers, no downloads, no dependencies on this project.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">Browsers change dramatically</span>
<span class="file-desc">The recovery tool uses standard JavaScript and the Web Crypto API — browser fundamentals, not trends.</span>
</div>
<div class="file">
<span class="file-name">You forget how this works</span>
<span class="file-desc">Each bundle's README.txt explains everything. Your friends don't need to remember anything — it's all written down for them.</span>
</div>
</div>

The things that *do* need to be true: your device is trusted when you create bundles, and the browser used for recovery isn't compromised. These are the same assumptions you make any time you use a computer for something important.

For a detailed technical evaluation, see the [security review]({{GITHUB_REPO}}/blob/main/docs/security-review.md).

## How It Compares {#comparison}

ReMemory isn't the first tool to use Shamir's Secret Sharing. There are many others, from command-line tools to web apps. Here's what sets ReMemory apart:

- **Handles files, not just text.** Most Shamir tools only split passwords or short text. ReMemory encrypts entire files and folders.
- **Self-contained recovery tool.** Each friend receives `recover.html` — a complete recovery tool that runs in any browser, offline.\* No installation, no CLI needed.
- **Contact details included.** Each bundle includes a list of other friends and how to reach them, so coordination doesn't depend on you being available.
- **No server dependency.** Everything runs locally. There's no service to sign up for, no account to maintain, nothing that needs to stay online.

For a detailed comparison with other tools, see the [full comparison table on GitHub]({{GITHUB_REPO}}#other-similar-tools).

## CLI Alternative {#cli}

There is also a command-line tool for those who prefer a terminal or need to automate bundle creation.

<a href="{{GITHUB_REPO}}/blob/main/docs/guide.md" class="btn btn-secondary">Read the CLI Guide</a>

<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
The CLI provides the same functionality, plus batch operations and scripting.
</p>

## Advanced: Anonymous Mode {#anonymous}

When holders should not know each other's identities, use **anonymous mode**:

- People are labeled as "Share 1", "Share 2", etc.
- No contact information is collected or stored
- READMEs skip the "Other Share Holders" section
- Bundle filenames use numbers instead of names

### When to Use Anonymous Mode

This is useful when:

- Holders should not know each other
- You're testing quickly without entering names
- You have another way to coordinate recovery
- Privacy is a higher priority than ease of coordination

### How to Enable

In the [bundle creator](maker.html), enable the **Anonymous** toggle in the Friends section:

- The friend list is replaced by a share count
- Set how many shares and the threshold
- Bundles are named `bundle-share-1.zip`, `bundle-share-2.zip`, etc.

### Recovery in Anonymous Mode

Recovery works the same way, but without the contact list. Holders see generic labels like "Share 1" instead of names.

<div class="warning">
<strong>Important:</strong> Without a built-in contact list, make sure holders know how to reach each other when recovery is needed.
</div>

## Advanced: Multilingual Bundles {#multilingual}

Each person can receive their bundle in their preferred language. Seven languages are supported: English, Spanish, German, French, Slovenian, Portuguese and Chinese (Taiwan).

### How It Works

- Each friend entry has a **Bundle language** dropdown
- "Default" uses the current UI language
- Override per person to mix languages
- recover.html opens in the selected language
- Anyone can switch languages at any time

<figure class="screenshot">
<img src="screenshots/multilingual-language-dropdown.png" alt="Friend entry showing the bundle language dropdown in the web UI" onerror="this.parentElement.innerHTML='<div class=\'screenshot-placeholder\'><div class=\'icon\'>📸</div>Screenshot: Friend entry showing the bundle language dropdown in the web UI</div>'">

<figcaption>Word lists are translated too (both languages work)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Advanced: Time-Delayed Recovery {#timelock}

You can set a waiting period when creating bundles. Even if your friends combine their pieces early, the files stay locked until the date you chose — 30 days, 6 months, a specific date.

### How to Enable

In the [bundle creator](maker.html), switch to **Advanced** mode and check **Add a time lock**. Choose how long the files should stay locked.

### Recovery

When someone opens a time-locked bundle before the date, the recovery tool shows a waiting notice. Once the time passes, recovery proceeds normally.

Opening a time-locked archive requires a brief internet connection. Your files aren't sent anywhere — the connection verifies that enough time has passed. Without the time lock, recovery is fully offline.

<div class="warning">
<strong>Experimental.</strong> Time-delayed recovery depends on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/leagueofentropy/" target="_blank">League of Entropy</a>, a distributed network operated by serious organizations around the world. If this network stops operating before a time lock expires, that archive becomes unrecoverable. Bundles without a time lock are not affected.
</div>

### How It Works {#timelock-technical}

The League of Entropy produces a new cryptographic value every 3 seconds. Each value is numbered. You can predict which number corresponds to a given time, but the value for that number can't be produced early — not by anyone, including the network operators.

When you create a time-locked bundle, the archive is encrypted to a specific future value. The key to open it doesn't exist yet. It will come from the network when that moment arrives.

For a deeper look at the cryptography behind this, see the [drand timelock encryption documentation](https://docs.drand.love/docs/timelock-encryption/).
