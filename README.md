# 🧠 ReMemory

**Encrypt your files and split the key among people you trust.**

ReMemory splits a decryption key using Shamir's Secret Sharing and gives each person a self-contained tool to recover the files together — offline, in any browser.

## Recovery works without this project

Each person receives a bundle containing `recover.html` — a browser-based recovery tool. No servers. No dependencies. No need for this project to exist when recovery happens.

**[Download demo bundles](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/latest/download/demo-bundles.zip)** to try the recovery process yourself.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph seal["① SEAL (you do this once)"]
        A[Your Files] --> B[Encrypt with age]
        B --> C[Split key into 3 shares]
        C --> D1[Alice's bundle]
        C --> D2[Bob's bundle]
        C --> D3[Carol's bundle]
    end

    subgraph recover["② RECOVER (friends do this together)"]
        R1[Alice opens recover.html] --> R2[Her share is pre-loaded]
        R2 --> R3[Adds Bob's share]
        R3 --> R5{2 of 3 shares}
        R5 -->|Threshold met| R6[Files unlocked]
        R6 --> R7[Download files]
    end

    D1 -.-> R1
    D2 -.-> R3
```

Any 2 shares can reconstruct the key, but a single share reveals nothing — not "very little," mathematically zero information.

The number of people and the threshold are up to you: 2-of-3 for a small circle, 3-of-5 for a wider group, or 2-of-2 for a couple.

## Two Ways to Use ReMemory

### 🌐 Web UI (recommended)

Create bundles in your browser — no installation required.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Create Bundles** | [eljojo.github.io/rememory/maker.html](https://eljojo.github.io/rememory/maker.html) |
| **Documentation** | [eljojo.github.io/rememory/docs.html](https://eljojo.github.io/rememory/docs.html) |

Everything runs locally. Your files never leave your device.

### 💻 CLI

For automation, scripting, or if you prefer the terminal.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install eljojo/rememory/rememory

# Linux (x86_64)
curl -Lo rememory https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/latest/download/rememory-linux-amd64
chmod +x rememory
sudo mv rememory /usr/local/bin/

# Nix
nix run github:eljojo/rememory
```

See the **[CLI User Guide](docs/guide.md)** for complete documentation.

## Try It First

Before protecting real secrets, try the recovery process:

1. **[Download demo bundles](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/latest/download/demo-bundles.zip)** (contains 3 sample bundles)
2. Open `bundle-alice/recover.html` in your browser
3. Alice's share is pre-loaded — add Bob's or Carol's
4. When enough shares are added, the files unlock

This is the closest thing to what a real recovery feels like.

## What Friends Receive

Each friend gets a ZIP bundle containing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.txt` | Instructions, their unique share, contact list |
| `README.pdf` | Same content, formatted for printing |
| `MANIFEST.age` | Your encrypted files (only included separately when over 10 MB) |
| `recover.html` | Recovery tool (~300 KB), runs in any browser. For smaller archives, everything is embedded — just open this file |

**A single share reveals nothing.** But tell your friends to keep their bundle somewhere safe — it's their responsibility to you.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why ReMemory?</summary>

We all have digital secrets that matter: password manager recovery codes, cryptocurrency seeds, important documents, instructions for loved ones. What happens to these if you're suddenly unavailable?

Traditional approaches fail:
- **Give one person everything** → Single point of failure and trust
- **Split files manually** → Confusing, error-prone, no encryption
- **Use a password manager's emergency access** → Relies on company existing
- **Write it in a will** → Becomes public record, slow legal process

ReMemory takes a different approach:
- **No single point of failure** — requires multiple people to cooperate
- **No trust in any one person** — even your most trusted friend can't access secrets alone
- **Offline and self-contained** — recovery works without internet or servers
- **Designed for non-technical people** — clear instructions, not cryptographic puzzles

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why I Built This</summary>

Two things drove me to create ReMemory.

First, I watched [a documentary about Clive Wearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_P7Y0-wgos), a man who has lived with a 7-second memory since 1985. Seeing how fragile memory can be made me think about what would happen to my digital life if something similar happened to me.

Second, I've had several concussions from cycling accidents. Each time, I've been lucky to recover fully. But each time, I've been reminded that our brains are more fragile than we like to think.

ReMemory is my answer: a way to ensure the people I trust can access what matters, even if I can't help them.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Threat Model</summary>

ReMemory assumes:
- Your friends will only cooperate when needed
- At least *threshold* friends will keep their bundle safe
- Your device is trusted when you create bundles
- The browser used for recovery is not compromised

ReMemory does NOT rely on:
- Any server or cloud service
- Any ReMemory website or infrastructure
- Any long-term availability of this project
- The internet during recovery

See the **[Security Review](docs/security-review.md)** for details.

<details>
<summary>Cryptographic Guarantees</summary>

| Component | Algorithm |
|-----------|-----------|
| Encryption | [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) (scrypt passphrase mode) |
| Key derivation | scrypt (N=2²⁰, r=8, p=1) |
| Secret sharing | Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(2⁸) |
| Integrity | SHA-256 checksums |
| Passphrase | 256 bits from crypto/rand |

**A single share reveals nothing about your secret.** This is a mathematical guarantee of Shamir's Secret Sharing — any fewer than *threshold* shares contains zero information about the original secret.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Failure Scenarios</summary>

| What if... | Result |
|------------|--------|
| A friend loses their bundle? | Fine, as long as threshold friends remain |
| A friend leaks their share publicly? | Harmless without threshold-1 other shares |
| ReMemory disappears in 10 years? | `recover.html` still works — it's self-contained |
| Browsers change dramatically? | Pure JavaScript with no external dependencies |
| You forget how this works? | Each bundle's README.txt explains everything |
| Some friends can't be reached? | That's why you set threshold below total friends |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Development</summary>

```bash
# Using Nix (recommended)

# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test         # Unit tests
make test-e2e     # Browser tests (requires: npm install)

ReMemory isn't the first tool to use Shamir's Secret Sharing. Its focus is making recovery possible for non-technical people, without installing anything.

**Key takeaways:**

- Most tools only handle **text or passphrases** — [eljojo/rememory](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory), both horcrux projects, [henrysdev/Haystack](https://github.com/henrysdev/Haystack), [cyphar/paperback](https://github.com/cyphar/paperback), and [msolomon/keybearer](https://github.com/msolomon/keybearer) are the few that handle actual files.
- Only [eljojo/rememory](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory) generates a **self-contained recovery tool** (`recover.html`) bundled with each share — no installation, no internet, no CLI needed.
- Only [eljojo/rememory](https://github.com/eljojo/rememory) includes **contact details** in each bundle so friends know how to reach each other during recovery.
- [paritytech/banana_split](https://github.com/paritytech/banana_split) and [cyphar/paperback](https://github.com/cyphar/paperback) output **QR codes** for printing, which is great for paper-based backups of short secrets.
- **Bitwarden Emergency Access** is fundamentally different — it delegates vault access to one trusted person (not M-of-N splitting) and requires an online service.
- [potatoqualitee/eol-dr](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr) is not a tool but a valuable **end-of-life planning [checklist](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr/blob/main/checklist.md)** covering accounts, finances, subscriptions, and devices — complementary to any tool here.
- [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/) is the classic Unix implementation but is limited to 128 ASCII characters and requires a terminal.
- GitHub offers a [successor feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/repository-access-and-collaboration/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-personal-accounts-repositories) for maintaining ownership continuity of repositories — useful for ensuring your code projects remain accessible.
